Social Skills
- I worked for 5 years for PPL, inc. as an attendant for children with special needs. I cared for a variety of children, and I was tasked with taking them out and helping them socialize in a way that is acceptable. Thanks to my experiences in PPL, I know how to interact with others in a way that is both professional and fitting.
Telecommunication Skills
- In my free time, I like to pursue professional videogaming. I am familiar with and have all the hardware to stream my computer work. I am highly capable of common telecommunication tasks, such as managing audio and video for team meetings.
Hardware
- I am a big fan of the Maker movement! I love to tinker and build things, my computer is hand-assembled, I built my own 3d Printer, and I am working on a custom computer chair to make it more comfortable when I program. I also have a lot of experience with Audio hardware: I love collecting headphones, I have built my own guitar pedal, and I modify gameboys for creating music.
